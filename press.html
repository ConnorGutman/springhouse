        <p>Soaring property values in New York neighborhoods once associated with crime and poverty are producing healthy profits for developers who jumped in early.
          <br>Consider this recent deal: Springhouse Partners' Adam Verner just purchased two Harlem apartment buildings with 59 mostly-rent-regulated units and seven retail spaces for $15.4 million. The seller was Treetop Development, a New Jersey investment
          company that bought them for $8.8 million in 2012.</p>

        <p>The city’s young real estate entrepreneurs are using unique investment strategies to become tomorrow’s success stories.
          <br>In some circles, youth correlates with impatience and rash decisions, but these relative newcomers to the ferce and congested New York City market are identifying eﬀective strategies — and valuable assets — and sticking to them.
          <br>“Because I’m young, I tend to be a little bit more selective with the properties we invest in,” said 32-year-old Adam Verner, who founded Springhouse Partners in 2010. “It’s very important to me to make prudent investment decisions to be sure
          that these frst few deals are successful.”</p>
